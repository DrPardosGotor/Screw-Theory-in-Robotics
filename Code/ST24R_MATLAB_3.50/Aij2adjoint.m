%% "AIJ2ADJOINT" Computes ADJOINT TRANSFORMATION for list of twists-mag.
% Use in SE(3).
% Notation useful for Link Jacobian (mobile).
% Notation useful for Christofell Symbols.
% Use in SE(3).
%
% 	Ad = Aij2adjoint(i,j,TwMag)
%
% INPUTS:
% TwMag = [Tw1; Mag1, ..., Twn; Magn] (7xn)
% for each rigid body joint (link 1..n).
% Twn1..Twn6: The TWIST components for the joint SCREW movement.
% Magn: The MAGNITUDE component for the joint SCREW movement.
%
% ADJOINT TRANSFORMATION: This is a special notation which gives us a most 
% form of the Adjoint of an open chain manipulator
% We use this notation for an easy calculation of the Manipulator Inertia 
% Matrix and the Manipulator Coriolis Matrix. 
% Computes the Adg in R^6 (6x6 matrix) from any robot link.
