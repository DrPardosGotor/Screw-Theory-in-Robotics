%% "GeoJacobianT" computes Geometric Jacobian refered to the Link frame
% Use in SE(3).
%
% 	JstL = GeoJacobianL(TwMag,Hsl0,Li)
%
% GEOMETRIC JACOBIAN in a LINK frame: At each configuration of theta,
% maps the joint velocity vector, into the corresponding velocity of the
% end effector TOOL.
% The "ith" column of jst is the "ith" joint twist, written with respect
% to the tool frame at to the currentmanipulator configuration.
%
% INPUTS:
% TwMag = [Tw1; Mag1, ..., Twn; Magn] (7xn)
% for each rigid body joint (link 1..n).
% Tw1..Twn: The TWIST components for the joint SCREW movement.
% Mag1..Magn: The MAGNITUDE component for the joint SCREW movement.
% Hsl0 is the pose of the link frame "L", associated to the Center o Mass
% at the reference (home) configuration or the manipulator.
% Li: link number.
%
% JstL = (Ad(Hsl0)^-1)*[Ai1*E1 ... Aii*Ei 0 ... 0] (6xn)
% where Aij = Aij2Adjoint and En are the Twists.
