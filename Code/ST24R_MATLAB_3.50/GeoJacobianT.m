%% "GeoJacobianT" computes Geometric Jacobian refered to the Tool frame
% Use in SE(3).
%
% 	JstT = GeoJacobianT(TwMag,Hst0)
%
% GEOMETRIC JACOBIAN in TOOL frame: At each configuration of theta,
% maps the joint velocity vector, into the corresponding velocity of the
% end effector TOOL.
% The "ith" column of jst is the "ith" joint twist, written with respect
% to the tool frame at to the currentmanipulator configuration.
%
% INPUTS:
% TwMag = [Tw1; Mag1, ..., Twn; Magn] (7xn)
% for each rigid body joint (link 1..n).
% Twn1..Twn6: The TWIST components for the joint SCREW movement.
% Magn: The MAGNITUDE component for the joint SCREW movement.
% Hst0 is th location of the tool frame "T" at the reference configuration.
