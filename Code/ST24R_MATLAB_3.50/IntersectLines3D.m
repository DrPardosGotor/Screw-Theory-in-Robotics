%
% Compute a point "m" (3x1) in intersectin of two lines in 3D.
% Axis is the matrix (3x2) with the Axis x1 & x2 of the two lines.
% Point is the matrix (3x2) with the Points p1 & p2 on the two lines.
%
% c = p1 ; a point on the Axis of line1.
% e = x1 ; Axis or DIRECTION VECTOR (normalized) for line1.
% d = p2 ; a point on the Axis of line2.
% f = x2 ; Axis or DIRECTION VECTOR (normalized) for line2.
%         || f x g || 
% m = c + ----------- e ; for  || f x g || & || f x e || in same direction
%         || f x e || 
%
%         || f x g || 
% m = c - ----------- e ; for  ||f x g|| & ||f x e|| in different direction
%         || f x e ||
