%% "NPotentialAij" POTENTIAL matrix N(t) for an open chain manipulator.
% computation based on the Adjoint Transformation Aij.
% Use in SE(3).
% A N(t) NEW FORMULATION completely algebraic in ST24R by Dr. Pardos-Gotor
% not seen before in the literature. It allows to get the Potential matrix
% in Dynamics, avoiding the differentiation of the Potential Energy V(t).
%
% 	Nt = NPotentialAij(TwMag,LiMas,PoAcc)
%
% Gives the POTENTIAL MATRIX N(t) for the Lagangian's equations: 
% M(t)*ddt + C(t,dt)*dt + N(t) = T
% of the dynamics of the robot formed by links on an open chain.
% It does not consider friction N(t, dt) and only gravitational N(t).
%
% INPUTS:
% TwMag = [Tw1; Mag1, ..., Twn; Magn] (7xn)
% for each rigid body joint (1..n).
% Tw1..Twn: The TWIST components for the joint movement.
% Mag1..Magn: The MAGNITUDE component for the joint SCREW movement.
% LiMas = [CM1; IT1; Mass1, ..., CMn; ITn; Massn] (7xn)
% for each rigid body link (1..n).
% CM1..CMn: Center of Mass x-y-z Position components to S for each Link.
% IT1..ITn: Inertia x-y-z components for each Link refered to its CM.
% Mass1..Massn: The Mass for each Link.
% PoAcc = Vector (3x1) with the accelerations for potential energies.
% e.g PoAcc = [0 0 -9.8] if the only acceleration is gravity on -Z axis.
%
% OUTPUTS:
% N(t) (nx1) potential matrix for the dynamics expression.
% Even though it is normally used only with the gravity on Z, the
% expression is genral for whatever selection of axes and even for other
% types of acceleration. Imagine a mobil robot in 3D (e.g. drone) or a 
% space robot with different values and directions for gravity.
