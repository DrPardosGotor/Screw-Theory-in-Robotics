%% Screw Theory - CANONICAL Inverse Kinematics.
% Pardos-Gotor SEVEN (PG7).
%
% Calculate IK for three consecutive rotation SCREWS.
% Find the Inverse Kinematics of 3 consecutive ROTATIONS SCREWS with
% two PARALLEL axes and one SKEW axis.
% which applied to a point move it ot a different point in space in SE(3)
%
% the movements are defined by the SCREWS whose "Twists" parameters
% are: Axis = [Axis1 Axis2 Axis3], Point = [p1 p2 p3], JointType = 'rot'
% and whose magnitudes are defined by Mag = [Theta1 Theta2 Theta3].
%
% Compute angles "Th3", "Th2" & "Th1" of three subsequently applies SCREWS
% with corresponding twists x3, x2 and x1, to move the point "p" to "k".
% Beware of the order for the movement: first X3 + x2 & subsequently x1.
% Point p is first moved to the point "e" or "f" by the Screw with Theta3
% then moved to the point "c" or "d" by the Screw with Theta2
% and then moved from "c" or "d" to the point "k" by the Screw with Theta1.
%
% For checking the this function, this exercise has 3 steps:
% STEP1: Apply ForwardKinemats to the Screws for any Mag (t3 + t2 + t1)
% (can be even more than 2pi) on pp and then getting a feasible pk.
% STEP2: Calculate the IK solution by PG6 getting the magnitud
% The problem could have up to FOUR TRIPLE solutions
% Theta123 = [t1ck t2ec t3pe; t1ck t2fc t3pf; t1dk t2ed t3pe; t1dk t2fd t3pf;]
% as a consequence of paths: p-e-c-k, p-f-c-k, p-e-d-k, p-f-d-k.
% STEP3: Test the solutions applying
% ForwardKinemats to the Screws on pp and checking we get the same pk.
