%% Screw Theory - INVERSE & FORWARD DIFFERENTIAL Kinematics
% ABB IRB6620LX.
% GEOMETRIC Jacobian.
%
% For the exercise of the Screw Theory for Robotics Handbook, the aim is to
% demonstrate the differential kinematics formulations (inv + for).
% FIRST goal is to calculate the INVERSE (Joint Thetap Velocities)
% Diferential Kinematics, based on the known or desired Tool Velocities.
% SECOND goal is to calculate the FORWARD (Tool Velocities)
% Diferential Kinematics, based on the known Joint Velocities.
