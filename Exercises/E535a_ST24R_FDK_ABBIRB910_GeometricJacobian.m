%% Screw Theory - DIFFERENTIAL Kinematics.
% ABB IRB 910SC
%
% The goal of this exercise is to prove the forward (Tcp Velocities)
% calculation, based on: GEOMETRIC JACOBIAN
% by Dr. Pardos-Gotor ST24R "Screw Theory Toolbox for Robotics" MATLAB.
%
% Four different approach are used for the Geometric Jacobian.
% 1.- Geometric Jacobian in the Spatial S system by Inspection
% 2.- Geometric Jacobian in the Spatial S system by Definition
% 3.- Geometric Jacobian in the Tool T system by Definition.
% 4.- Geometric Jacobian in the Link L system by Definition.
% Of couse the result is the same, but they are different alternatives
% inside the ST24R toolbox to calculate Geometric Jacobians.
