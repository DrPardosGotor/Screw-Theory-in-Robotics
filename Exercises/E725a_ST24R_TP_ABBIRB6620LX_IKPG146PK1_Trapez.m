%% Screw Theory - EXAMPLE Trajectory Planning with Inverse Kinematics.
% ABB IRB6620LX.
% IK Algorithm applied: PG1 + PG4 + PG6 + PK1.
% Trapezoidal interpolation for Joint Trajectory Planning.
%
% The goal of this exercise is to TEST:
% TRAJECTORY PLANNING
% by Dr. Pardos-Gotor ST24R "Screw Theory Toolbox for Robotics" MATLAB.
%
% For checking the quality of this IK solution, this exercise has 5 steps:
% STEP1: Apply ForwardKinemats for the Robot for random Mag Theta1...6
% getting a feasible set of TcP configuration (rot+tra) PATH in task-space.
% STEP2: Calculate the IK solutions by SCREW THEORY management getting
% the magnitud Theta1...6. There can be up to 4 right solutions
% Only one solution is chosen to build a set of Theta PATH in joint-space.
% STEP3: Test the joint path plannig applying Forward Kinemats only the 
% Waypoints of interest in the PATH checking TcP congiguration (rot+tra).
% STEP4: interpolate the joint path plannig with to complete a Joint
% Trajectory for the whole trajectory line.
% STEP5: Test the joint trajectory plannig applying Forward Kinemats to all
% the points in the TRAJECTORY checking TcP congiguration (rot+tra).
