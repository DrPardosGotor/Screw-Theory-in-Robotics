% Exercise 2.3.6: Exponential Rotation 
%
% Transform a vector rt(3;2;1) expressed in coordinates of the mobil system
% T(OUVW), to its expression rs? in coordinates of the reference system
% S(OXYZ). The system T(OUVW) is rotated by an angle gamma(pi/4) with
% respect to the axis OZ of the system S(OXYZ).
