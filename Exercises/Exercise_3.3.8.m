%% Screw Theory for Robotics - FORWARD Kinematics.
% REDUNDANT & COLLABORATIVE robot - KUKA IIWA R820
% Home "vertical" configuration.
%
% The goal of this exercise is to TEST:
% Calculate the Homogeneous Matrix transformation for the end-effector of
%
% Mechanical characteristics of the Robot (AT REF HOME POSITION):
% po = Origen for he STATIONARY system of reference.
% pk = point in the crossing of the DOF Th1(rot) & Th2(rot) & Th3(rot).
% pr = point in the axis of Th4(rot) Th5(rot).
% pf = point in the crossing of the DOF Th5(rot), Th6(rot), Th7(rot).
% pp = TcP Tool Center Point
% hst0 = Tool (TcP) configuration (rot+tra) at robot reference position.
