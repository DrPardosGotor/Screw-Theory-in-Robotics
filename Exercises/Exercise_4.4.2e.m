%% Screw Theory - EXAMPLES Inverse Kinematics.
% ABB IRB120 (TOOLDOWN).
% Compare THREE ways to solve the IK of this robot:
%
% The goal of this exercise is to TEST:
% INVERSE KINEMATICS for IRB120 ToolDown POSE
% by Dr. Pardos-Gotor ST24R "Screw Theory Toolbox for Robotics" MATLAB.
%
% Mechanical characteristics of the Robot (AT REF POSITION):
% po = Origen for he STATIONARY system of reference.
% pk = point in the crossing of the DOF Th1(rot) & Th2(rot).
% pr = point in the axis of Th3(rot).
% pf = point in the crossing of the DOF Th4(rot), Th5(rot), Th6(rot).
% pp = TcP Tool Center Point
% hst0 = Tool (TcP) configuration (rot+tra) at robot reference position. 
%
% For checking the quality of this IK solution, this exercise has 3 steps:
% STEP1: Apply ForwardKinemats for the Robot for "whatever" Mag Theta1...6
% so getting a feasible TcP configuration (rot+tra) as Hst.
% STEP2: Calculate the IK solutions by SCREW THEORY management getting
% the magnitud Theta1...6. There can be up to 8 right solutions for this
% problem using this approach (theoretically there is max of 16 solutions).
% STEP3: Test the different solutions applying ForwardKinemats to Robot
% with Theta = [t11...t61; t12...t62; ...; t18...t68] and checking we get
% the same TcP configuration (rot+tra) as Hst.
