%% Screw Theory - INVERSE DIFFERENTIAL Kinematics.
% ABB IRB 120.
% INVERSE Geometric Jacobian.
%
% The goal of this exercise is to solve for the Joint Velocities, taken
% the Tool pose velocities (i.e. TcP position and T frame rotation vel).
% The calculation is based on: Inverse GEOMETRIC JACOBIAN
% by Dr. Pardos-Gotor ST24R "Screw Theory Toolbox for Robotics" MATLAB.
%
% FIST
% define the INPUTS are:
% VtS = the desired velocity for Tool Pose in spatial frame (S).
% Path = Trajectory in the plane X-Z defined by four points t1..t4.
% SECOND 
% For each point in the trajectory we need the joints magnitudes, Therefore
% we must solve the Inverse Kinematics problem for the robot in the poses.
% THIRD
% Calculate the TWISTS for the robot.
% Calculate the GEOMETRIC JACOBIAN.
% Solve the joint velocities for the trajectory with the inverse Jacobian
