% Exercise 7.2.3b: ABB IRB120 (TOOLUP).
% Invese Differential Kinematics Algorithm with Screw Geometric Jacobian.
% Quintic Interpolation for the Joint Path Planning.
%
% The goal of this exercise is to TEST:
% TRAJECTORY PLANNING inside the workspace of the robot.
% by Dr. Pardos-Gotor ST24R "Screw Theory Toolbox for Robotics" MATLAB.
%
% For checking the quality of this IK solution, this exercise has 5 steps:
% STEP1: Apply ForwardKinemats for the Robot for random Mag Theta1...6
% getting a feasible set of TcP configuration (rot+tra) PATH in task-space.
% Employ some interpolation method to complete the trajectory between the
% points of the end-effector path planning, till the discretization of
% timeline. Small enough for limited changes of path planning magnitudes
% between consecutive points.
% STEP2: Evaluate the inverse DK by SCREW THEORY getting an approximation
% to the magnitud Theta1...6. Only one solution in joint-space.
% the INVERSE (Joint Thetap Velocities) DK, based on Tool Velocities.
% STEP3: Test the joint path plannig applying Forward Kinemats only the 
% Waypoints of interest in the PATH checking TcP congiguration (rot+tra).
% STEP4: interpolate the joint path plannig with to complete a Joint
% Trajectory for the whole trajectory line.
% STEP5: Test the joint trajectory plannig applying Forward Kinemats to all
% the points in the TRAJECTORY checking TcP congiguration (rot+tra).
